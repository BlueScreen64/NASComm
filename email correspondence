Hello, Mr. Pollock,
I am writing to you with regard to your request for proposal. My team and I are in the process of drawing up the paperwork and have  a few questions for you concerning the implementation of a new voicemail system.
First of all, what system do you have currently in place in terms of networks, connectivity, and PC type? 
Secondly, what type(s) of operating systems are installed?
Also, do all computers have access to a direct port?
Most importantly, do you intend to install new equipment?
Please indicate the total number of ports. Are they digital or analog?
Lastly, will you be seeking continued support from us, or do already have an existing vendor? 
Thank you for your interest in NASComm. We look forward to having the opportunity to work with you.

Best Regards,
Clendenin Odegard
Chief Executive Team Leader
